<p>My name is Zecheng (Victor) Wang. I am a recent graduate of New York University Shanghai, now working as Research Assistant with <a href="https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/">Professor Keith Ross</a> at NYU Abu Dhabi. Currently, our research focuses on Deep Reinforcement Learning topics such as pre-training effects on RL, cross-environment learning, as well as using scalable architectures (such as the Transformer) in RL. See our latest topic <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00771.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate years, I worked with <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam">Professor Yik-Cheung Tam</a> on Natural language processing topics such as task-oriented dialogue systems and retrieval-augmented language modeling. See our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096450">paper at ICASSP 2023</a>.</p>

<p>During my study away program at NYU New York, I joined <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/ai-scientific-research">AI for Scientific Research Group</a> as machine learning specialist working on solving scientific problems with ML solutions. Later I become the ML Lead for the group responsible for multiple teams of the group. Currently, I act as an ML advisor for the group.
 
<p>I conducted my capstone project with Professor Keith Ross on modeling simultaneous machine translation with Reinforcement Learning framework. See the <a href="https://victor-wang-902.github.io/Zecheng_wang_capstonepdf.pdf">report</a>.</p>
