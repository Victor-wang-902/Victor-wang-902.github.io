title: About me
---

My name is Zecheng (Victor) Wang. I am a senior student at NYU Shanghai majoring in computer science and data science. I'm currently doing research with [Prof. Yik-cheung (Wilson) Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam) and [Prof. Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/).
I'm interested in many topics in machine learning while particularly focusing on natural language processing. Specifically, I want to understand how we can capture the semantics underlying natural language to achieve generalized language models, which can be extended to other modalities. I have worked on dialogue systems, language modeling, and machine translation.
