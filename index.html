<p>My name is Zecheng (Victor) Wang. I am a senior student at NYU Shanghai majoring in computer science and data science. I’m currently doing research with <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam">Prof. Yik-cheung (Wilson) Tam</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/">Prof. Keith Ross</a>.</p>
<p>I’m interested in many topics in machine learning while particularly focusing on natural language processing. Specifically, I want to understand how we can capture the semantics underlying natural language to achieve generalized language models, which can be extended to other modalities. I have worked on dialogue systems, language modeling, and machine translation.</p>
